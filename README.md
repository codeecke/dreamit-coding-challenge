# My solution for the coding-challenge

Hi I'm glad to present my code. I had some challenges (new technologies) and hope you will not recognize them ğŸ˜œ

I'm looking forward for our personal exchange. But first, let's start with the code ğŸ˜‰

## Setup

### 1. Make sure to use node 19.8.1

(Maybe it runs with other versions, I only want to make sure)

* [Download and install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) nvm (node-version-manager)
* open the termin in project-folder
* run `nvm install`

### 2. Install yarn
```
> npm i -g yarn
```

### 3. install dependencies
```
> yarn
```

### 4. start the project
```
> yarn dev
```
